# Intro
Python is majorly used for ML/DL applications. Numpy and Pandas are used commonly. Operations of large datasets comprising of text, images etc can be performed. The idea is to predict a target variable given other parameters based on some pre-exisiting data.
These algorithms/techniques can be of different types.
